  "user_objective": "The Academic Research Assistant helps users conduct research by searching academic sources (e.g., ArXiv, PubMed), summarizing findings, and organizing them into comprehensive reports. It can understand complex research questions, find relevant papers, extract key information, and present it in a structured format.",
  "builder_objective": "The Academic Research Assistant aims to improve the quality and efficiency of academic research by providing accurate information from reliable sources while helping users discover connections between different research papers that might not be immediately obvious.",

  "intro": "Academic research requires thorough literature reviews across multiple databases like ArXiv, PubMed, and academic journals. This process involves searching for relevant papers, reading and understanding complex content, extracting key information, and synthesizing findings into coherent reports. The Academic Research Assistant streamlines this process by automating searches, summarizing papers, and organizing information in a structured format.",
